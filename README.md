# grakn_musicbrainz_sample_migration
A sample script and ontology to migrate musical entities from musicbrainz.org to grakn graph databases. 

PS: In this example, we only used the first 100 artist,recording and release_group entities from the musicbrainz.org database.
For scrapping data from musicbrainz database there are set of functions available in the following repository if you have direct access to the database. Refer to https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Server/Setup for server setup.
